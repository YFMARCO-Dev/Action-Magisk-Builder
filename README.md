# Action-Magisk-Builder
This is for personal use only, for compiling and testing other Magisk forks (with different patches) without the need to re-fork them as my own. Workflow configurations were kanged (or adapted?) from the [Magisk repository](https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk), with minor modifications.
